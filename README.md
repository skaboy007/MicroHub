**MicroHub Manifest**

----------

**Introduction**

The MicroHub Manifest is a part of the MicroHub Initiative, it aims to establish a set of concrete specifications for developing and integrating microservices within a shared ecosystem. This manifest provides detailed guidelines to ensure interoperability, maintainability, and scalability while preserving the core principles of microservices architecture.

----------

**Goals**

-   **Interoperability**: Enable seamless communication between microservices developed by different contributors.
-   **Standardization**: Define clear standards for APIs, data formats, and protocols.
-   **Scalability**: Ensure services can scale independently without tight coupling.
-   **Maintainability**: Facilitate easy updates, debugging, and monitoring.
-   **Security**: Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.
-   **Community Collaboration**: Encourage open-source contributions under permissive licenses.

----------

**Specifications**

### 1. Communication Protocols

**Standard Protocols:**

-   **HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2**: For synchronous communication.
-   **gRPC**: For high-performance communication using Protocol Buffers.
-   **AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol)**: For asynchronous messaging (e.g., RabbitMQ).
-   **Kafka Protocol**: For streaming data and event-driven architectures.

**Requirements:**

-   Microservices **must** support HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2 for RESTful APIs.
-   For performance-critical services, supporting **gRPC** is recommended.
-   Asynchronous services **should** use standardized messaging protocols like **AMQP** or **Kafka**.

### 2. API Standards

**RESTful API Specifications:**

-   **OpenAPI 3.0**: Use for API definitions.
-   **CRUD Operations**: Implement standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
-   **Endpoint Design**:
    -   Use **nouns** for resources (e.g., `/users`, `/orders`).
    -   Support **pagination**, **filtering**, and **sorting** where applicable.

**GraphQL Specifications (Optional):**

-   For services requiring flexible queries, support **GraphQL** with a defined schema.

**Requirements:**

-   All APIs **must** provide an **OpenAPI 3.0** specification file (`swagger.json` or `swagger.yaml`).
-   APIs **must** handle errors using standardized HTTP status codes and provide meaningful error messages in a consistent format.

### 3. Data Formats

**Standard Data Formats:**

-   **JSON**: Default format for data exchange.
-   **Protocol Buffers**: For gRPC services.
-   **XML**: Only if required for legacy support.

**Requirements:**

-   Microservices **must** support **JSON** for request and response bodies.
-   Services using gRPC **must** use **Protocol Buffers** (`.proto` files) for message definitions.

### 4. Authentication and Authorization

**Standards:**

-   **OAuth 2.0**: For token-based authentication.
-   **OpenID Connect**: For identity verification.
-   **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For stateless authentication.

**Requirements:**

-   Services **must** implement OAuth 2.0 for authentication and accept **JWT** for stateless sessions.
-   Sensitive endpoints **must** require authentication and enforce authorization checks based on user roles and permissions.
-   Microservices **should** support mutual TLS (mTLS) for service-to-service authentication.

### 5. Versioning

**Practices:**

-   **Semantic Versioning (SemVer 2.0.0)**: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
    -   Increment **MAJOR** version when making incompatible API changes.
    -   Increment **MINOR** version when adding functionality in a backward-compatible manner.
    -   Increment **PATCH** version for backward-compatible bug fixes.

**API Versioning:**

-   Include versioning in API endpoints (e.g., `/v1/users`).
-   **Deprecation Policy**: Provide at least **6 months** notice before deprecating an API version.

**Requirements:**

-   Microservices **must** follow Semantic Versioning.
-   APIs **must** include version numbers in their endpoint URLs or through custom headers.

### 6. Containerization

**Standards:**

-   **Docker**: Use for containerizing microservices.
-   **OCI (Open Container Initiative)**: Compliance for container images.

**Dockerfile Guidelines:**

-   Use official base images (e.g., `node:14-alpine`, `python:3.9-slim`).
-   Minimize image size by removing unnecessary packages and using multi-stage builds.
-   Expose necessary ports using the `EXPOSE` directive.

**Requirements:**

-   Microservices **must** be containerized using Docker.
-   Docker images **must** be built following best practices to ensure security and efficiency.
-   Container images **should** be stored in a Docker registry that supports OCI standards.

### 7. Observability

**Logging:**

-   Use structured logging formats (e.g., JSON).
-   Include correlation IDs to trace requests across services.
-   Log at appropriate levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR.

**Monitoring:**

-   Expose metrics in **Prometheus** format at `/metrics` endpoint.
-   Implement health checks accessible at `/health` endpoint.

**Tracing:**

-   Use **OpenTelemetry** for distributed tracing.
-   Include trace IDs in logs and propagate them across services.

**Requirements:**

-   Microservices **must** implement structured logging and include correlation/trace IDs.
-   Services **must** expose Prometheus metrics and health check endpoints.
-   Tracing **must** be implemented using OpenTelemetry standards.

### 8. Documentation and Testing

**Documentation:**

-   Provide comprehensive README files with:
    
    -   Service description.
    -   Setup instructions.
    -   Configuration options.
    -   API documentation links.
-   Generate API documentation from OpenAPI specs using tools like **Swagger UI**.
    

**Testing:**

-   Include automated tests:
    
    -   **Unit Tests**: Cover individual components.
    -   **Integration Tests**: Verify interactions with other services or databases.
    -   **Contract Tests**: Ensure API contracts are met.
-   Use Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines to run tests on code commits.
    

**Requirements:**

-   Microservices **must** include a README and up-to-date API documentation.
-   Automated tests with minimum **80% code coverage** are required.
-   CI pipelines **must** be set up to enforce testing before merging code.

### 9. Licensing

**Permissive Licenses:**

-   **MIT License**
-   **Apache License 2.0**
-   **BSD 3-Clause License**

**Requirements:**

-   All microservices **must** be released under a permissive open-source license.
-   License files **must** be included in the root directory of the source code repository.

### 10. Compliance and Governance

**Repository Structure:**

-   Use standard directory structures:
    -   `/src`: Source code.
    -   `/tests`: Test cases.
    -   `/docs`: Documentation files.
    -   `/configs`: Configuration files.
    -   `/docker`: Docker-related files.

**Code Style Guidelines:**

-   Follow language-specific style guides (e.g., PEP 8 for Python, ESLint for JavaScript).
-   Use linters and formatters to enforce code quality.

**Security Practices:**

-   Regularly update dependencies to patch vulnerabilities.
-   Perform security scans using tools like **Snyk** or **OWASP Dependency-Check**.
-   Store secrets securely using environment variables or secret management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault).

**Requirements:**

-   Repositories **must** follow the standard structure.
-   Code **must** pass style checks and security scans before deployment.
-   Secrets **must not** be hardcoded or committed to repositories.

----------

**Conclusion**

The Microservices Marketplace Manifest provides concrete specifications to standardize the development and integration of microservices. By adhering to these guidelines, developers can create interoperable, scalable, and maintainable services that contribute to a robust and collaborative ecosystem.
